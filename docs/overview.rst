Input: 

In addition, there should be a `todo.txt`
saved to `info/` as well as a `star_info.csv`. The `todo.txt` is a basic text file with
one star ID per line, which must match the data ID to be read in properly. If no stars are
specified via command line, the star(s) listed in the text file will be processed by
default. This is convenient when running an ensemble of stars. 

Light curves and power spectra can be added, following a similar format: ID_LC.txt 
for the light curve and ID_PS.txt for the power spectrum. Please note: the units of the 
power spectrum MUST be in ppm^2 muHz^-1 for the software to work properly.
